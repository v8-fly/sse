Expanding Current Features
Advanced State Manipulation: Beyond merely viewing the grid's state, enabling developers to live-edit AG Grid properties directly from the dev tool's UI would be a significant enhancement. This could include modifying column definitions, adjusting filter models, changing sort models, or even simulating data updates. This capability aligns with React DevTools' ability to "modify the props a component is receiving for quick debugging" , which would significantly accelerate the debugging and prototyping process by allowing immediate testing of configuration changes without code modifications.   

Performance Profiling for AG Grid: Implementing a dedicated "Profiler" tab, drawing direct inspiration from React DevTools  and Angular DevTools , would provide invaluable insights. This feature would measure and visualize AG Grid rendering times, identify unnecessary re-renders, and pinpoint performance bottlenecks related to large data updates, complex filtering/sorting operations, or inefficient custom cell renderers. Potential metrics could include the time spent on initial grid render, duration of subsequent re-renders, the performance impact of applying or removing filters or sorts, identification of slow-performing cell renderers or value formatters, and overall frame rate analysis during grid interactions. This would elevate the tool from a diagnostic aid to an optimization powerhouse.   

"Time Travel" for Grid State: Inspired by Vue DevTools' powerful time travel debugging , allowing developers to step back through a chronological history of AG Grid state changes would revolutionize debugging complex sequences of events. This would enable inspection of how the grid's filters, sort order, column visibility, or data evolved over a user session, making it significantly easier to understand and debug complex sequences of events leading to a bug.   

Dependency/Event Flow Visualization: For highly complex grids with intricate configurations and numerous event listeners, a visual representation of data flow through various AG Grid APIs or how events propagate could be invaluable. This is analogous to Angular DevTools' "Injector Tree" , but adapted for AG Grid's event and data model, providing a clearer understanding of interdependencies.   

Configuration Validation/Suggestions: Based on the registered AG Grid version and current configuration, the tool could provide intelligent warnings or suggestions for best practices, common anti-patterns, or upcoming API changes that go beyond simple deprecation notices. This would proactively guide developers towards more robust and future-proof implementations, improving code quality and maintainability.
